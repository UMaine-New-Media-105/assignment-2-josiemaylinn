Assignment Two

Question One - https://editor.p5js.org/josiemaylinn/sketches/xR8QTg9f4

For this part of the assignment, I duplicated the Gridded Initials sketch from Assignment One and rewrote the code to use custom functions to draw all the shapes, rather than writing out all the shaped individually.

Question Two - https://editor.p5js.org/josiemaylinn/sketches/5fDoyNWKR

For this part of the assignment, I used the beginShape and endShape functions to draw a custom, closed shape using multiple vertexes that were all connected with lines. 

Question Three - https://editor.p5js.org/josiemaylinn/sketches/lpI2xuqlW

For this part of the assignment, I duplicated my sketch from Question Two and rewrote the code to create a function that can create my custom shape with one call and can be sized and translated. 

Question Four - https://editor.p5js.org/josiemaylinn/sketches/HScVsCgck

For the final part of the assignment, I found two flags from countries that began with my first and last initials to create a custom flag for a fake country. With my initials being JB, I made a flag that combined elements of the Japanese and Brazillian flag.
